# Abstract:
Applying deep learning to skin lesion image seg-
mentation has grown in popularity over the past few years.
It is simpler to understand the injuries and administer the
proper care using segmented images. In this research, we
proposed a new model, by building a multi-cross-attention
block, combining it with the transformer block and Unet
model. In particular, our multi-cross-spatial attention block
is highly effective when it comes to extracting features from
multiple layers, helping to increase efficiency in the image
upsample process. The transformer block that is widely used
in natural language processing (NLP) is incorporated into the
model, which helps to improve performance with processing
the highest features. Additionally, our model has the benefit of
having a small number of parameters in addition to providing
great performance on the two well-known datasets, ISIC 2018
and PH2
